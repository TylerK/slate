# Lyve's Style Guide

### Run the project:

Run the following in terminal from the root of the project. 

1. `npm install`
2. `gulp`

If everything went swimingly, you may now point your browser to http://localhost:9999 

If anything broke, please feel free to come by my desk and pelt me with small bits of fruit.
